# Hardware Architecture

The AI Pin uses a dual-core SoC to balance power efficiency and performance.

- A low-power core continuously monitors the microphone for a wake word.
- A high-performance core remains in sleep mode and wakes only when required.

This approach minimizes battery drain while supporting cloud-based AI features.
